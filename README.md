  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://your-domain.com/api/webhook"}'
```

### 3. Development

npm run dev
```

### 4. Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Database Schema

The application uses an in-memory store for demo purposes. In production, you can easily extend it to use any database by modifying the `applicationStore.ts` file.

### Application Object
```typescript
interface Application {
  id: string;
  telegramId: string;
  username: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName?: string;
  message: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'declined';
  submittedAt: Date;
  processedAt?: Date;
  adminNotes?: string;
}
```

## Extending the System

### Adding Database Support
1. Install your preferred database client (e.g., Prisma, MongoDB)
2. Replace the in-memory store in `lib/applicationStore.ts`
3. Update the API routes to use the database

### Adding Authentication
1. Install Next-Auth or similar authentication library
2. Add middleware to protect the dashboard routes
3. Implement admin user management

### Adding More Features
- Email notifications for admins
- Application categories
- File attachments support
- Multi-language support
- Application analytics

## Security Considerations

- Webhook validation (recommended for production)
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Admin authentication
- Input sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement
